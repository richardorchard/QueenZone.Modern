## Summary

<!-- What changed and why? -->

## Testing

<!-- e.g. dotnet test QueenZone.sln --configuration Release -->

- [ ] `dotnet restore QueenZone.sln`
- [ ] `dotnet build QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-restore`
- [ ] `dotnet test QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-build`
- [ ] Coverage gate passed locally (`scripts/Test-CoverageGate.ps1` with `-BaseRef origin/main`; see `AGENTS.md`)
- [ ] If this PR changes `src/QueenZone.Mobile`: `npm ci` + `npm run preflight` (typecheck, unit tests, **Expo Doctor** — not typecheck + Jest alone)
- [ ] Route/page tests avoid brittle CSS class or exact markup assertions unless markup shape is the contract
- [ ] If this PR touches EF migrations / `QueenZoneDbContext` / `Entities/`: `dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes` passed, and CI **EF migrations (Azure SQL)** is green (or you ran `dotnet ef database update` against the migration SQL Server locally)

## Legacy database checks

## Issues

<!-- If this PR fully resolves an issue, use a real closing keyword so GitHub auto-closes it on merge: "Closes #123" / "Fixes #123" / "Resolves #123". Use "Relates to #123" for issues this PR only touches. A prose mention elsewhere in this PR (e.g. "Implements #123") does NOT auto-close the issue and is checked by CI (pr-issue-link-check). -->

## Follow-up

<!-- Any skipped checks, known limitations, or post-merge work -->
