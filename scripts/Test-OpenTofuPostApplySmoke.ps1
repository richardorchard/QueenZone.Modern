.SYNOPSIS
  Post-apply checks for an OpenTofu production apply (issue #625).

.DESCRIPTION
  Runs the existing general route suite (Smoke-LiveSite.ps1), then adds the
  infra-specific checks #625 asks for that the general suite does not cover:

    - Direct Azure origin GET /health must return 403 (Cloudflare-only
      ingress; see infra/modules/azure-web and docs/architecture/azure-hosting-plan.md).
    - GET /health/ready must be reachable (status is reported, not hard-gated,
      since readiness can legitimately degrade independently of an infra apply).
    - cdn2.queenzone.org/songfiles/* must return 404 — the documented,
      safety-critical contract that fan-performance audio never leaks through
      the public Worker proxy (AGENTS.md "Media Serving",
      docs/architecture/azure-hosting-plan.md).
    - cdn.queenzone.org must still be proxied by Cloudflare (CF-Ray header
      present) — checked generically rather than against a specific photo
      blob, which could be deleted later and cause a false failure.

  The Application Insights freshness check is best-effort and never fails the
  script: it is evidence for a human reviewing the apply, not a release gate.

# On PS 7+ (pwsh, what the GitHub Actions runner uses), a non-2xx response's
# exception carries $_.Exception.Response as a System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage,
# whose .Headers is an HttpResponseHeaders instance -- it does NOT support
# ["Header-Name"] indexer syntax the way the success-path Invoke-WebRequest
# headers (or PS 5.1's WebException/WebHeaderCollection) do. Left as-is, a
# header lookup on the error path silently returns nothing even when the
# header is genuinely present (confirmed the hard way: cdn.queenzone.org's
# CF-Ray check failed post-apply smoke on a real 400 response that a manual
# curl proved DID carry CF-Ray). Normalize to a plain hashtable so downstream
# code can always use ["Header-Name"] regardless of PS edition or code path.

# Invoke-WebRequest throws on a non-2xx response on both PS 5.1 and PS 7+;
