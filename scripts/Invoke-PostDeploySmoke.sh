#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Public-domain smoke used by deploy.yml (and locally via bash).
# Default: wait for /warmup, then require 200 on the content routes.
# --warmup-only: /warmup gate used in the deploy job so this runner overlaps
# the zip-deploy worker restart instead of waiting for a second job. Pass
# --expect-build-version as well so warmup-only does not return green on the
# previous worker (/warmup is short-circuited and was ok in ~2s on the old
# process in #664). /warmup's remaining ceiling is its own dependency checks
# and cache priming (#674), not anything upstream of it (#681).
# Deploy still Kudu-recycles after the zip push: skipping that after #688 left
# /warmup on HTTP 500 even though the new data-build-version was already live.
# --sample-data omits the hard-coded production legacy topic while retaining
# the common route and API checks used by the isolated dev environment.
