# Agent Guide

This repository is the modern QueenZone rebuild. The project is archive-first: it should fully expose valuable legacy public content while keeping visitor-facing archive pages read-only. News is the first live editorial slice, so the architecture should also support newly approved news articles.

## Source Of Truth

- `README.md` gives the project overview and local development commands.
- `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md` defines the required testing layers (including CI Web.Tests mixed sharding).
- `docs/decisions/` contains accepted architectural decisions.
- `docs/decisions/0006-hybrid-ef-core-admin-writes.md` is the Dapper vs EF access matrix and contributor rules for SQL in `QueenZone.Data`.
- `docs/architecture/blob-storage-ugc.md` is the UGC blob upload foundation (`QueenZone.Storage` / `IBlobUploadService`).
- `docs/architecture/opentofu-inventory.md` is the live Azure/Cloudflare ownership inventory for OpenTofu adoption (`infra/import/` holds sanitised IDs).
- `docs/architecture/opentofu-contributor-runbook.md` is the OpenTofu operating contract, including `prevent_destroy` on SQL, Storage, and other irreplaceable resources. OpenTofu does not manage blob objects or SQL rows, and it will not automatically refuse to destroy a data store unless that lifecycle flag is set.
- `docs/decisions/0007-rich-text-editor-quill.md` is the shared Quill rich-text editor decision (partial + `/api/uploads/editor-image`).
- `docs/architecture/json-api-v1.md` is the versioned `/api/v1` JSON API contract (pagination, Problem Details, OpenAPI).
- `docs/decisions/0009-react-native-for-mobile-app.md` and `docs/decisions/0011-mobile-project-location-and-build-tooling.md` are the mobile client tech and project-location decisions. `docs/decisions/0012-react-navigation-app-shell.md` is the React Navigation shell and public vs member tab boundary.
- `docs/mobile-development-environment.md` is the shared Windows/macOS native toolchain (Node 24, JDK 17, Android SDK 36).
- `docs/backlog/migration-backlog.md` tracks migration work.
- `docs/sql/data-api-builder-mcp.md` explains the local SQL MCP setup for read-only legacy database investigation.
- `docs/agent-bitwarden-secrets.md` is the multi-machine Bitwarden Secrets Manager (`bws`) setup for local agents (Windows vs macOS).
- `.cursor/agents/` and `.cursor/skills/orchestrate-epic/` are the QueenZone overlay for the sequential GitHub issue queue (planner / implementer / verifier / reviewer). Pin `/orchestrate-epic` as a Custom Mode. The portable protocol is the **issue-queue** Cursor plugin (`~/.cursor/plugins/local/issue-queue`, skill `/orchestrate-issues`). This repo keeps copies so a clone works without the plugin. Sequential only: one issue, one subagent at a time; one review plus one response, then PR.

Keep durable workflow guidance in this file and keep user-facing setup guidance in `README.md`.

## UI Architecture

`QueenZone.Web` uses ASP.NET Core Razor Pages for server-rendered pages. Public archive pages, news pages, and admin editorial screens should live under `src/QueenZone.Web/Pages` as `.cshtml` files with page models.

Do not build visitor-facing or admin pages by streaming inline HTML from minimal route handlers. Minimal endpoints are appropriate for small non-page responses such as `/health` or the versioned JSON API under `/api/v1` (`src/QueenZone.Web/Api/`). Existing narrow endpoints in `src/QueenZone.Web/Endpoints/` (RSS, uploads, streaming) stay outside that contract. See `docs/architecture/json-api-v1.md`.

The React Native client lives at `src/QueenZone.Mobile/` as an Expo development-build project (TypeScript, `expo-dev-client`, Continuous Native Generation). Keep it out of `QueenZone.sln`. Expo Go is not a supported runtime. Native `ios/` and `android/` output is generated at build time and is not committed. Navigation is React Navigation (bottom tabs + native stacks per tab); signed-out vs signed-in surfaces follow ADR 0012. See `src/QueenZone.Mobile/README.md`.

## Branch And Pull Request Policy

Do not push feature work directly to `main`.

Use a branch named after the agent doing the work, not a single shared prefix. The agent slug must match whoever is performing the task so parallel work from different tools stays distinguishable.

Branch format:

```text
{agent}/{task}
```

- `{agent}`: lowercase slug for the active agent or assistant (for example `grok`, `claude`, `codex`, `composer`).
- `{task}`: short kebab-case description of the work (for example `news-pagination`, `seo-foundation`).

Examples:

| Agent / tool    | Prefix      | Example branch                | Auto label     |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Grok            | `grok/`     | `grok/news-pagination`        | `agent:grok`   |
| Claude Code     | `claude/`   | `claude/seo-foundation`       | `agent:claude` |
| Codex           | `codex/`    | `codex/legacy-news-dedup`       | `agent:codex`  |
| Cursor Composer | `composer/` | `composer/health-smoke-tests` | `agent:composer` |
| Cursor Agent    | `cursor/`   | `cursor/news-pagination`      | `agent:cursor` |
| New tool        | `{name}/`   | `my-tool/forum-archive-review`| `agent:{name}` |

GitHub Actions applies the matching `agent:*` label from the branch prefix via `.github/workflows/agent-pr-label.yml`.

Use the prefix for the agent you are, not a default from an earlier session or another tool. Different agents working on the same area should use different branch names, such as `grok/news-pagination` and `claude/news-pagination`, rather than reusing one shared branch.

### Open a pull request when a task is finished

When an agent finishes a task that changed tracked files, commit the work, push the branch, and open a pull request against `main` — don't leave finished work sitting uncommitted or unpublished for the user to package up. This applies once the change is actually complete and verified (default verification passed, or a clear note on what was skipped and why); it does not mean opening a PR mid-task or for exploratory/throwaway work the user didn't ask to keep.

Exceptions: skip auto-opening a PR when the user says they'll commit or push themselves, when work is explicitly a draft/spike not meant for review, or when repo/session instructions say not to. If a git identity, push access, or `gh` auth isn't available, say so instead of silently skipping.

### Update from `main` before opening a pull request

The default branch is **`main`** (not `master`). `main` is protected: required CI checks and merge gates evaluate the PR against the current tip of `main`. If a feature branch was cut hours or days earlier, `main` may have moved — an outdated PR base can block or confuse checks (coverage vs `origin/main`, migration jobs, mergeability) until the branch is updated.

**Before creating a PR** (and before asking for review on a long-lived branch), always:

```powershell
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# or: git rebase origin/main
```

Prefer a merge of `origin/main` into the feature branch unless the user or stack workflow asks for a rebase. Resolve any conflicts, re-run the default verification (or the subset relevant to the conflicted files), then push and open or update the PR.

Do this even when the branch was originally created from `main` — time between branch creation and PR open is when `main` usually changes.

Before merging to `main`, open a pull request and fill in `.github/pull_request_template.md`. The pull request should include:

- Which agent authored the change.
- Summary of the change.
- Tests run.
- Whether real legacy database checks were run.
- Any skipped checks or known follow-up work.

For multi-session work, use `docs/agent-handoff-cheatsheet.md`.

### Linking issues so merge auto-closes them

Fill in the template's `## Issues` section with a real GitHub closing keyword — `Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`, or `Resolves #123` — for every issue the PR fully resolves. GitHub only auto-closes an issue on merge when one of those keywords appears; a prose mention like "Implements #123" or a bare `[#123](...)` link anywhere else in the PR body (including `## Summary`) does not trigger it and leaves the issue open after merge. Use `Relates to #123` for issues the PR only touches without resolving. The `pr-issue-link-check` CI job fails the PR if it references an issue number without a recognized closing or relating keyword, so use the correct keyword up front rather than fixing it after the check fails.

## Cursor issue-queue orchestration

Cursor custom subagents are markdown files in `.cursor/agents/` (`planner`, `implementer`, `verifier`, `reviewer`, `orchestrator`). The QueenZone spawn protocol lives in `.cursor/skills/orchestrate-epic/SKILL.md` (overlay: surfaces, tests, `cursor/` branches, no worktrees). Pin that skill as a Custom Mode (`/orchestrate-epic`, then Alt+Enter on Windows or Option+Enter on Mac), or invoke `/orchestrator`. Do not also pin `/orchestrate-issues` in the same QueenZone chat.

The same loop is packaged as the **issue-queue** Cursor plugin for other repos: clone or copy `~/.cursor/plugins/local/issue-queue` onto the machine, reload Cursor, pin `/orchestrate-issues`. Product rules stay in that repo's `AGENTS.md`. Change the loop in the plugin first, then copy it into the QueenZone overlay.

Use `/orchestrate-epic` here for **one issue** (`work on #757`), an epic's children, or an explicit list (`work on #15 #16 #17`). Skip planner when the queue has a single issue. The parent keeps a scoreboard and loops **one issue at a time** through implementer → verifier → reviewer → (one implementer response if the review requested changes) → PR so child context does not accumulate in the parent chat. Reviewer runs once per issue; do not send the same ticket back for a second review. Do not run sibling implementers in parallel. Share the parent checkout; do not isolate a git worktree per issue (that re-runs `dotnet restore` via `.cursor/worktrees.json` and is the usual cause of a slow queue). Website and `src/QueenZone.Mobile` are both in scope; do not mix those surfaces in one implementer unless the issue requires both. Child branches use `cursor/` unless the prompt names another agent.

Grok 4.6 effort: parent high (xhigh only if the split is messy), planner high, implementer medium, verifier high, reviewer high.

## Testing Expectations

Follow `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md`.

### Default verification before a pull request

```powershell
dotnet restore QueenZone.sln
dotnet build QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet format QueenZone.sln --verify-no-changes
dotnet test QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-build
```

Use deterministic sample or fake data for normal unit and web integration tests. Real legacy database tests must be opt-in and clearly reported.

When changing EF `SqlQueryRaw` projections over legacy tables, check the real SQL Server column types or cast projections to the C# row model types explicitly. Many legacy IDs and counts are `smallint`, which SQL Server materializes as `System.Int16`; in-memory route tests will not catch `Int16`-to-`Int32` mapping failures. Prefer a deterministic SQL-shape test plus an opt-in read-only legacy DB probe for new public legacy read surfaces.

Legacy read probes and self-cleaning write probes run automatically every night via `.github/workflows/nightly-legacy-checks.yml`. They use a same-day SQL Express mirror synced from the live Azure SQL DB, never the live database. The read probes run on macOS over the LAN; write probes run locally on the Windows SQL Express host. This is continuous signal, not a PR gate. See `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md` ("Data Integration Tests").

### The `E2E` hosting environment

`QueenZoneEnvironments.E2E` (`src/QueenZone.Web/Infrastructure/QueenZoneEnvironments.cs`) is a second automated-test environment, distinct from `Testing`: it composes the same test auth handlers (`UsesTestAuth`) and in-memory blob storage (`UsesInMemoryBlobStorage`) as `Testing`, but it does **not** use in-memory data (`UsesInMemoryData` matches only `Testing`) — it points at the real SQL Express mirror instead, so the nightly Playwright suite can exercise real legacy rows, `smallint`/`bit` projections, and encoding edge cases that sample data cannot reproduce.

**`Testing` must never be given a real connection string.** `WebApplicationFactory` tests (207+ files in `QueenZone.Web.Tests`) rely on `Testing` always resolving to in-memory sample data regardless of what `ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` happens to be set to in the ambient environment — that is the guarantee `QueenZoneWebServiceCollectionExtensions.cs` provides by short-circuiting to `AddQueenZoneInMemoryData()` before it even reads the connection string for `Testing`. If `Testing` were changed to read a real connection string, every WAF test would start silently depending on whatever database happened to be configured on the machine or CI runner, and a bad row in that database could make unrelated PRs fail (or, worse, pass against stale data) for reasons that have nothing to do with the code under test. `E2E` exists as a separate environment specifically so this guarantee never has to be relaxed.

`E2E` has its own guard in the other direction: `E2EConnectionGuard.EnsureSafe` (`src/QueenZone.Web/Infrastructure/E2EConnectionGuard.cs`) runs at startup and refuses to boot unless `ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` targets the `queenzone_legacy_sync` database on an allow-listed local SQL Express server (`localhost\SQLEXPRESS` and equivalents, or the Mac runner's LAN address to the Windows box, `glory11`). It mirrors `scripts/Assert-SqlExpressMirrorConnection.ps1` in-process, so a misconfigured nightly run can never point the write-heavy Playwright suite at Azure SQL or any other remote server — the guard fails closed on an empty connection string too, rather than silently falling back to in-memory data the way `Testing` does.

Run the E2E-suite locally or on demand with `scripts/Run-E2E.ps1`:

```powershell
# Same as the PR merge gate (Testing environment, in-memory, Deterministic category):
powershell -File ./scripts/Run-E2E.ps1 -Mode Deterministic

# Nightly real-data suite against the SQL Express mirror (E2E environment):
$env:ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy = "Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=queenzone_legacy_sync;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
powershell -File ./scripts/Run-E2E.ps1 -Mode RealData

# Read-only sweep against a deployed site, no local app or database:
powershell -File ./scripts/Run-E2E.ps1 -Mode LiveSite -BaseUrl https://www.queenzone.org
```

See `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md` ("Nightly UI Regression (Real Data)") and `docs/architecture/self-hosted-e2e-runner.md` for suite content, runner setup, and troubleshooting.

When a change touches private messaging writes, SortKey assignment, or conversation locking, prefer the opt-in SQL Express mirror probe after the EF migration is applied:

```powershell
$env:ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy = "Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=queenzone_legacy_sync;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
$env:RUN_PRIVATE_MESSAGE_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-PrivateMessaging.ps1
```

`ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` must point to `queenzone_legacy_sync` on the local SQL Express instance. The script rejects Azure SQL and remote servers. The probe creates throwaway members, concurrent first-sends and replies, asserts IDENTITY `SortKey` + `LastMessageSortKey` tip consistency, then deletes the probe rows. Report whether it was run or skipped.

When a change touches admin news writes or discovery-to-news promotion, prefer running the opt-in admin write probe before release or after deployment verification:

```powershell
$env:RUN_LEGACY_WRITE_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-AdminNewsLegacyWrites.ps1
```

`ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` must point to `queenzone_legacy_sync` on the local SQL Express instance. The script rejects Azure SQL and remote servers. It runs the admin news write lifecycle probe, the news-section `Admin_news_*` write Facts, and the self-seeding discovery promotion probe.

When a change touches modern forum thread/post writes, prefer:

```powershell
$env:RUN_FORUM_WRITE_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-ForumWrites.ps1
```

When a change touches photo or article submissions, or photo-submission promotion into the public gallery (`PIC_FILES_T` / `PIC_CAT_T`), prefer:

```powershell
$env:RUN_CONTENT_SUBMISSION_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-ContentSubmissions.ps1
```

`ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` must point to `queenzone_legacy_sync` on the local SQL Express instance. The script refuses Azure SQL and remote servers. It runs `EfContentSubmissionLiveProbeTests`: photo/article submission status transitions plus the self-cleaning photo-promotion probe (inserts a visible `PIC_FILES_T` row joined to a real `PIC_CAT_T` category via the same repository path as `PhotoSubmissionPromotionService`, then deletes probe rows). Report whether it was run or skipped.

When a change touches member account create or external logins, prefer:

```powershell
$env:RUN_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-MemberAccounts.ps1
```

When a change touches admin URL ingestion, the news-agent run-request queue, or the local `process-news-requests` runner, prefer the opt-in URL ingestion probe after the EF migration is applied:

```powershell
$env:ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy = "Server=localhost\SQLEXPRESS;Database=queenzone_legacy_sync;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True"
$env:RUN_NEWS_AGENT_URL_INGESTION_PROBE = "true"
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-NewsAgentUrlIngestion.ps1          # schema + queue only
powershell -File .\scripts\Probe-NewsAgentUrlIngestion.ps1 -Full    # fetch + triage (optional OpenRouter key)
```

Both modes delete their requests, heartbeats, candidates, evidence, AI runs, and drafts before returning. The full probe never publishes. Report whether it was run or skipped.

### Pull request CI gates (must pass before merge)

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yml` blocks merge when these fail:

| Check | Requirement | Blocks PR? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Build** | `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build` (Release), uploads binaries + Linux publish artifact | Yes |
| **Formatting** | `dotnet format QueenZone.sln --verify-no-changes` (matches root `.editorconfig`; CRLF via `.gitattributes`) — runs as its own job in parallel with Build/Test, not a Build step | Yes |
| **Test (sharded)** | Mixed `QueenZone.Web.Tests` shards (Release, Coverlet) | Yes |
| **Small test projects** | `Tools`/`Storage`/`NewsAgent` test projects, in parallel with the Web.Tests shards | Yes |
| **Global line coverage** | At least **51%** across the union of deterministic suite reports | Yes |
| **Changed-line coverage** | At least **70%** of changed, coverable `.cs` lines in the PR diff vs `main` | Yes |
| **Smoke test** | Published app responds on `/health`, `/`, `/news` (starts after `build`, overlaps coverage) | Yes |
| **EF migrations (Azure SQL)** | When migration-related paths change: `has-pending-model-changes` + `database update` against the deploy SQL Server | Yes (job runs only for those PRs) |
| **Playwright e2e** | Self-hosted runner selected by the `e2e` label (Windows or macOS) | Yes (required PR merge gate; not rerun by deploy) |
| **Mobile JS** | `npm ci`, `scripts/check-npm-advisories.mjs` (high/critical fail-closed; see `src/QueenZone.Mobile/npm-advisory-allowlist.md`), typecheck, `npm run test:coverage`, `scripts/Test-MobileCoverageGate.mjs`, and Expo Doctor in `src/QueenZone.Mobile` when that tree (or the mobile coverage scripts) changes | Runs when mobile files change; skipped otherwise (non-matrix skip is treated as passing) |
| **Mobile Android build** | Unsigned debug APK via `expo prebuild` + `gradlew assembleDebug`, uploaded as a 1-day workflow artifact | Runs when mobile files change (or `workflow_dispatch`) |
| **Mobile iOS build** | Unsigned Simulator build via `expo prebuild` + `xcodebuild`; prefers an idle self-hosted `ios-build` Mac and falls back to `macos-26`; zipped and uploaded as a 1-day artifact | Runs when mobile files change (or `workflow_dispatch`) |

PRs that only change `src/QueenZone.Mobile/` (or docs/infra/design) skip the .NET build, tests, coverage, smoke, e2e, and the App Service deploy. Mixed web + mobile PRs run both. See `scripts/classify-pipeline-changes.sh` and `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md`.

Coverage exclusions are configured in `coverlet.runsettings`. EF Core files under `**/Migrations/**/*.cs` are excluded from coverage metrics.

The changed-line gate compares `git diff origin/main...HEAD` for `*.cs` files. Large new modules (services, repositories, workers) usually need targeted unit or integration tests, often with fakes or SQLite/in-memory EF, or the gate will fail.

### CI Web.Tests sharding (agents)

CI parallelizes `QueenZone.Web.Tests` with **mixed** shards (light unit tests + `WebApplicationFactory` tests in every shard). Scripts: `scripts/Get-WebTestShardFilter.ps1`, `scripts/Invoke-WebTestsShard.ps1`. Full policy and anti-patterns: `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md` (section **CI test sharding**).

- Local default remains `dotnet test QueenZone.sln` (no filter).
- **Do not** split CI/jobs as unit-only vs WAF-only for speed — measured regression in [#442](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/442).
- No shard manifest to maintain when adding tests; discovery is automatic from `*Tests` classes.

### EF migration PRs (required before merge)

If the PR touches any of:

- `src/QueenZone.Data/Migrations/`
- `src/QueenZone.Data/QueenZoneDbContext.cs`
- `src/QueenZone.Data/QueenZoneDbContextFactory.cs`
- `src/QueenZone.Data/Entities/`

then CI runs **EF migrations (Azure SQL)** against the same database as deploy (`QUEENZONE_LEGACY_MIGRATION_CONNECTION_STRING`). Unit/SQLite tests do **not** catch SQL Server batch-binding errors or Azure SQL timeouts.

For a safer earlier look before that real-database run, `.github/workflows/test-migrations-against-mirror.yml` (manual `workflow_dispatch`) applies pending migrations to the SQL Express mirror instead — the same disposable, nightly-refreshed copy `nightly-legacy-checks.yml` maintains, with real data. Check "resync first" to force a fresh copy from the live DB (~3-5 min), or leave it against whatever's already there. Not a replacement for the real check: the mirror can be up to a day stale, so a clean run here doesn't guarantee a clean run against the actual deploy target.

Locally, before opening such a PR:

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet ef migrations has-pending-model-changes --project src/QueenZone.Data/QueenZone.Data.csproj --startup-project src/QueenZone.Web/QueenZone.Web.csproj

$env:ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy = "<migration connection string>"
dotnet ef database update --project src/QueenZone.Data/QueenZone.Data.csproj --startup-project src/QueenZone.Web/QueenZone.Web.csproj
```

Rules of thumb for hand-written SQL migrations:

- Separate dependent DDL into separate `migrationBuilder.Sql(...)` calls (SQL Server batch binding).
- Prefer idempotent SQL; large indexes may need `suppressTransaction: true` and a higher command timeout.
- Keep the EF model snapshot in sync (or add a no-op sync migration).

### Pre-PR verification (recommended before opening the PR)

Run the [default verification](#default-verification-before-a-pull-request) first, then the same coverage gate CI enforces so failures are caught early:

```powershell
git fetch origin main
# After default restore/build/format, collect coverage and gate:
dotnet test QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-build --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --settings coverlet.runsettings --results-directory ./TestResults
powershell -File ./scripts/Test-CoverageGate.ps1 -Reports ./TestResults -GlobalLineThreshold 51 -ChangedLineThreshold 70 -BaseRef origin/main
```

On Linux or GitHub Actions, use `pwsh` instead of `powershell` for the last command.

If the gate reports uncovered changed lines, it prints up to 20 `path:line` entries. Add or extend tests until changed-line coverage is at least 70%.

When the PR changes `src/QueenZone.Mobile`, run the same host-free gate CI uses before the coverage job — not typecheck + Jest alone:

```powershell
cd src/QueenZone.Mobile
npm ci
npm run preflight
```

`npm run preflight` is typecheck + unit tests + Expo Doctor. Doctor's package-version check consults Expo's current SDK list, so a lockfile that passed this morning can fail CI the same afternoon when Expo publishes a patch (`npx expo install <package>`). Do not skip Doctor on mobile PRs.

When the PR also changes production TypeScript/TSX, run the mobile coverage gate (floors in `scripts/mobile-coverage-floors.json`; do not copy the web C# 51%/70% numbers):

```powershell
cd src/QueenZone.Mobile
npm run coverage
```

Full detail, test-layer guidance, and coverage troubleshooting: `docs/architecture/testing-policy.md` (sections **Continuous Integration**, **Mobile coverage gates**, and **Pre-pull request checklist**).

## Local Secrets

Do not commit secrets.

Local secrets belong in ignored files such as:

- `src/QueenZone.Web/appsettings.Local.json`
- `src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker/appsettings.Local.json`
- `.env`

Commit only examples such as `.env.example`.

Bitwarden **Secrets Manager** (`bws` CLI) is the shared local secret store for development agents on Richard's machines. This is **not** the password-manager CLI (`bw`). Full multi-machine setup (Windows vs macOS, install paths, troubleshooting): [`docs/agent-bitwarden-secrets.md`](docs/agent-bitwarden-secrets.md).

Rules for agents:

- Use **`bws`**, never `bw login`, for QueenZone App Service–style secrets.
- Authenticate with user-scoped **`BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`**; do not ask the user to paste the token into chat; never print tokens or secret values (key names and value lengths only).
- Machine account: **`windows-codex`** on Windows, **`mac-codex`** on Macs (separate tokens per host).
- Project: **`Queenzone Development`** (`1c16fd2d-4bfb-4eb7-8357-b49400233490`).
- **This Windows workstation:** `bws` lives at `%USERPROFILE%\bin\bws.exe` with `%USERPROFILE%\bin` on the User `Path`; token is User env `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Restart agent shells after Path changes.

ImageSharp 4 builds require `SIXLABORS_LICENSE_KEY`. On an authorised Windows or
macOS machine, import it from Bitwarden without displaying the value:

```powershell
. ./scripts/Import-SixLaborsLicense.ps1
```

Use `-PersistForUser` only on Windows when new IDE/agent processes need the value;
restart them afterward. macOS agents import it into each new `pwsh` session.
Hosted agents receive the key through their platform secret manager, never through
a copied local Bitwarden machine token. External contributors must obtain their
own Six Labors licence. See `docs/agent-bitwarden-secrets.md` for renewal and
troubleshooting. Never commit `sixlabors.lic` or print the licence value.

```powershell
$env:BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN", "User")
bws secret list "1c16fd2d-4bfb-4eb7-8357-b49400233490"
```

App Service setting names are the canonical secret keys in Bitwarden, including `ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy`, `ConnectionStrings__BlobStorage`, `AzureAd__*`, `Authentication__*`, `Admin__AllowedEmails__*`, `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING`, `MobileAuth__SigningKey`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Azure App Service settings are a separate store: updating Bitwarden does not update Azure App Service, except for `MobileAuth__SigningKey`, which the deployment workflow deliberately reconciles before deploying. GitHub Actions fetches its deploy secrets (`AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE`, `QUEENZONE_LEGACY_MIGRATION_CONNECTION_STRING`, and `MOBILE_AUTH_SIGNING_KEY`) from this same Bitwarden project at workflow runtime via `bitwarden/sm-action` — see `docs/bitwarden-secrets.md`. When credentials rotate, update every authoritative target deliberately and verify by name plus value length, not by printing values.

The deployed App Service runtime database setting is `ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy`. The current production route uses SQL authentication, stored in Azure App Service configuration, not in the repository.

`QUEENZONE_LEGACY_MIGRATION_CONNECTION_STRING` is fetched by the deploy workflow from Bitwarden (mapped from the same `ConnectionStrings__QueenZoneLegacy` secret) for EF Core migrations. Updating that Bitwarden secret does not update the live App Service runtime connection string, which is configured separately in Azure App Service settings. When database credentials rotate, update both places as needed and restart the App Service before verifying production.

For production debugging (log stream, Azure CLI, Azure MCP tenant setup, and forum smoke checks), see `docs/agent-handoff-cheatsheet.md`.

Admin Entra app registration, App Service `AzureAd__*` settings, and **client secret rotation** (renew by 2028-07-01): `docs/architecture/entra-admin-auth.md`.

Hosting scale/cost: production is **single-instance B1** with **no Redis**; see `docs/architecture/hosting-scale-and-cache.md` before proposing multi-instance or distributed cache work.

For local SQL MCP access through Azure Data API Builder, see `docs/sql/data-api-builder-mcp.md`. Keep the MCP surface narrow and read-oriented by default.

News agent worker and admin review queue: see `docs/architecture/news-agent.md`. OpenRouter key goes in `src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker/appsettings.Local.json`. Manual OpenRouter smoke test: `scripts/Smoke-NewsAgent.bat`. Admin review UI: `/admin/news-discovery` (requires `Admin:AllowedEmails` from App Service or `appsettings.Local.json` — committed `appsettings.json` ships an empty allowlist; member OAuth at `/account/login` is unrelated).

Never log secrets (connection strings, client secrets, storage keys, OpenRouter keys, or Six Labors licence values) into issues, PR text, or application telemetry properties.

## Media Serving

Two Cloudflare hostnames serve Azure Blob Storage content. They are **not interchangeable** — pick the right one for the content type.

| Hostname | Type | Can set response headers? | Use for |

| `cdn.queenzone.org` | Straight CDN proxy | No | Photos and images (`PhotoImageUrl`) |
| `cdn2.queenzone.org` | Cloudflare Worker proxy (script `pictures-queenzone-org` on `cdn2.queenzone.org/*`) | Yes (cache/CORS/nosniff) | Legacy forum attachment redirect target. Returns 404 for `/songfiles/*`. |

Fan-performance audio is **not** a public CDN object. Signed-in members stream through `/fan-performances/{id}/audio`, which reads the private `songfiles` container and sets `Content-Disposition`. Do not emit `cdn2.queenzone.org/songfiles/…` or raw blob URLs in HTML.

`pictures-queenzone-org` is the Worker **script name**, not a DNS hostname. The public host is `cdn2.queenzone.org`. Retired `pictures.queenzone.org` is a compatibility hostname only (Worker `pictures-legacy-redirect` → `cdn`); do not use it for new media URLs. Legacy forum attachments use `cdn2` after a member-auth gate (`/forum/attachment/legacy/{postId}`). New forum uploads live in private `ugc-forum` and download via `/forum/attachment/{postId}/{attachmentId}` (member-only, app-streamed).

## Migration Principles

- Preserve public content first.
- Keep the public archive read-only for visitors.
- Allow deliberately designed editorial workflows for new approved news articles.
- Do not port Web Forms architecture.
- Keep all SQL Server access inside `QueenZone.Data` (no ad-hoc SQL in page models/tools). See ADR 0006 for the Dapper/EF matrix: new writes default to EF; complex legacy/projected reads may keep SQL/procs; target direction is EF Core as the single client library while retaining stored procedures for hot paths.
- Treat the legacy database as an import source and historical reference. Forum public reads use modern projected tables by default; other public content may keep reading legacy tables unless performance or safety problems appear.
- Prefer clean, stable, search-friendly canonical URLs over preserving legacy URL shapes.
- Never expose private, hidden, deleted, moderated, or credential-related data by default.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

Environment: .NET 10 SDK is preinstalled at `/usr/local/dotnet` and symlinked to `/usr/local/bin/dotnet` (already on `PATH`). The startup update script runs `dotnet restore QueenZone.sln` and `dotnet tool restore`; standard build/test/run commands live in `README.md` and above.

Because the startup restore runs before normal task work, Cursor Cloud must inject
`SIXLABORS_LICENSE_KEY` through its encrypted environment secrets before startup.
Do not place a local `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` in Cursor Cloud. If the licence secret is
absent, the ImageSharp 4 restore/build is expected to fail; ask the user to
configure the environment rather than exposing the key in chat or repository files.

No database is required for local development. When `ConnectionStrings:QueenZoneLegacy` is empty (the default), the app uses in-memory/sample data, so `dotnet run --project src/QueenZone.Web/QueenZone.Web.csproj` starts with zero external services (defaults to `Development` at `http://localhost:5146`). `dotnet run` builds `Debug` by default; do not pass `--no-build` unless you have already built the `Debug` configuration (the `--configuration Release` builds live under `bin/Release`).

Exercising admin editorial routes locally without real Entra: admin routes require Microsoft Entra sign-in unless `AzureAd:ClientId` is blank, in which case a test-header auth fallback is active. `appsettings.json` ships a placeholder `ClientId`, so create a git-ignored `src/QueenZone.Web/appsettings.Local.json` that sets `AzureAd:ClientId` to `""` and lists an allowed admin email under `Admin:AllowedEmails`. Then authenticate admin requests by sending the `X-Test-User-Email: <allowed-email>` header. Admin POSTs need the `__RequestVerificationToken` antiforgery field, so fetch the form first and reuse its token plus cookie. The news article body is validated as plain text (HtmlSanitizer), so a body containing HTML tags is rejected with "Article body must be plain text."
