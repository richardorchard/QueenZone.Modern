# QueenZone iOS App Store release pack

Prepared 29 August 2026. This pack is version-neutral and can be used while the first public build remains undecided.

## Recommended release model

- Create the App Store Connect record now and leave it in **Prepare for Submission**.
- Use `1.0` for the first public App Store version unless there is a product reason to expose a pre-1.0 number.
- Continue uploading TestFlight builds with increasing `CFBundleVersion` values. Choose the final build only when release scope is settled.
- The submitted build's `CFBundleShortVersionString` must match the App Store version.
- Use manual release after approval for the first version.

## Pack contents

- `metadata-en-AU.md` — copy-ready English (Australia) listing text.
- `privacy-and-compliance.md` — draft privacy-label answers and compliance checklist.
- `review-notes.md` — reviewer instructions with placeholders for private credentials.
- `screenshot-plan.md` — required sizes, shot list, captions and capture rules.
- `manifest.md` — asset provenance and completion status.
