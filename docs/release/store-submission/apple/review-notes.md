## Notes for reviewer

QueenZone is an independent, fan-run Queen archive and community and is not affiliated with Queen or its representatives.

Most archive, news and photography features are available without signing in. To review member-only functionality, use the supplied review account:

1. Open QueenZone and select the profile avatar from Home.
2. Sign in with the supplied review account.
3. Forum posting is available from the Forum tab. Please create clearly identified test content and remove it when finished if the UI offers that option.
4. Private messages are available from the member profile. `[ADD A SECOND SAFE TEST RECIPIENT OR EXPLAIN THE REVIEW FIXTURE]`.
5. Photo submission is available from Photography. Submissions enter moderation and do not publish immediately.
6. News suggestions can be opened from News. Suggestions enter editorial review and do not publish automatically.
7. Notification preferences and account deletion are available in Settings.
8. The “On This Day” widget can be added from the iOS Home Screen widget gallery.

The app uses the camera and photo library only after the user selects a photo-submission or avatar action. It does not record audio. Fan-performance audio is streamed to signed-in members through QueenZone rather than exposed as a public file URL.

Account deletion immediately hides the member identity and starts a 30-day cooling-off period. After that period, personal sign-in information is permanently purged while public/community records retain anonymous attribution for archival integrity.

If a backend feature is unavailable during review, contact `[REVIEW EMAIL]` and `[REVIEW PHONE]`.
