# Privacy and compliance draft

This is a conservative draft based on the source tree and production configuration. Re-audit it against the exact release build immediately before submission.

## App privacy label

Answer **Yes, data is collected**. Do not declare tracking unless the final app or an included SDK combines QueenZone data with third-party data for advertising or measurement across other companies' apps/sites.

Likely collected data types:

| App Store data type | Linked to identity | Tracking | Purpose / source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Name | Yes | No | Member profile, contact requests |
| Email address | Yes | No | Account, authentication, contact requests |
| User ID | Yes | No | Account/session and member API operations |
| Device ID / push token | Yes | No | Push registration and notification delivery |
| Photos or videos | Yes when submitted | No | Avatar and moderated photo submissions |
| Other user content | Yes | No | Forum posts, private messages, news suggestions, contact messages |
| Product interaction | Possibly | No | Sentry navigation/performance traces; confirm final Sentry event fields |
| Crash data | Possibly | No | Sentry crash/error reporting when enabled |
| Performance data | Possibly | No | Sentry performance tracing when enabled |

For each collected type, select only purposes actually used. Expected purposes are **App Functionality** and, for diagnostics, **Analytics**. Do not select Third-Party Advertising, Developer Advertising or Other Purposes unless the final build genuinely uses them.

Items selected by a user from their camera or photo library and uploaded to QueenZone count as collection; merely reading a local image without transmitting it would not.

## Permissions and privacy manifests

- Camera: used only when the member chooses to take a photograph for an avatar or gallery submission.
- Photo library: used only when the member chooses an image for an avatar or gallery submission.
- Notifications: request after contextual explanation; settings remain available in-app.
- No microphone/recording permission is configured.
- Confirm all included SDK privacy manifests and required-reason API declarations in the archived build.

## Age rating

Recommended working assumption: **13+ or the regional equivalent**, subject to Apple's generated result.

Questionnaire considerations:

- User-generated content: Yes — forum posts and submitted material.
- Messaging/chat: Yes — private member messages.
- Profanity or crude humour: Infrequent/possible because historical community content is user-generated.
- Mature or suggestive themes: Infrequent/possible in music journalism and archive material.
- Contests, gambling, loot boxes and simulated gambling: None unless the final feature set changes.
- Unrestricted web access: Normally No; links opening a system browser do not by themselves make the app a general-purpose browser. Verify final behaviour.
- Parental controls and age assurance: None currently identified.

## User-generated content controls

Before submission, confirm the release candidate visibly supports:

- Reporting objectionable forum content.
- Blocking or restricting unwanted private contact where applicable.
- Moderation and enforcement processes.
- Published contact information for users to reach QueenZone.
- Terms that prohibit abusive or unlawful content.

## Accounts and sign-in

- Sign in with Apple must be offered wherever equivalent third-party consumer sign-in is offered, unless a guideline exception clearly applies.
- Account deletion is available in-app and at `https://www.queenzone.org/data-deletion`.
- Verify the deletion flow in the release build and describe the 30-day cooling-off period accurately.

## Export compliance

The Expo configuration declares only exempt encryption usage. Confirm the final binary uses encryption solely through standard OS/network security and eligible SDK functionality, then answer App Store Connect consistently. If any non-exempt or proprietary cryptography is added, reassess before uploading.

## Content rights and independence

- QueenZone is an independent fan archive and must not imply official affiliation.
- Review rights for photographs, audio, artwork, logos, articles and imported legacy content.
- Ensure the store copy, screenshots and icon do not imply endorsement by Queen or its representatives.
- Fan-performance audio is member-gated; verify every recording offered in the app is authorised for distribution.

## Business and regional declarations

- Complete Digital Services Act trader/non-trader status for EU availability.
- Confirm tax category and the free price tier.
- Review South Korea, China mainland and Vietnam declarations only if distributing there and App Store Connect presents them.
