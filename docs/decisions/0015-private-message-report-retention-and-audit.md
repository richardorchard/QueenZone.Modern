# ADR 0015: Private Message Report Retention And Moderator Access Audit

## Status

Accepted and implemented.

- **Decision 1** (snapshot survives independent of the live message) was already true of the existing `PrivateMessageReportEntity` snapshot fields; nothing further was needed.
- **Decision 2** (180-day terminal-status purge) is implemented: `IPrivateMessageRepository.PurgeExpiredReportsAsync` (`src/QueenZone.Data/Repositories/EfPrivateMessageRepository.cs`, `InMemoryPrivateMessageRepository.cs`) deletes reports whose most recent `StatusChanged` audit row is older than `PrivateMessageLimits.ReportRetentionAfterTerminalStatus`, run daily by `PrivateMessageReportPurgeHostedService` (`src/QueenZone.Web/Member/PrivateMessageReportPurgeHostedService.cs`).
- **Decision 3** (audit log) is implemented end to end: the `PrivateMessageReportAuditLogEntity` table (migration `20260825105513_AddPrivateMessageReportAuditLog`), and the admin moderator review surface at `/admin/private-messages` (issue #470, `src/QueenZone.Web/Pages/Admin/PrivateMessages/`) writes a `Viewed` row on each report detail-page load and a `StatusChanged` row on each status transition, via `IPrivateMessageRepository.AppendReportViewedAuditAsync`/`UpdateReportStatusAsync`.
- **Decision 4** (user-facing labels) is reflected in the admin UI copy on the report detail page, which explicitly describes the snapshot as retained independently of the live conversation rather than implying a hard delete.

## Context

Issue [#473](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/473) asks for a documented retention, deletion, and audit policy for private messaging, with the acceptance criterion that "permanent deletion behavior is documented before implementation."

Part of #473 is already settled and shipped:

- Message timestamps and per-user archive/removal state exist today on `PrivateMessageEntity` and `PrivateConversationParticipantEntity` (`src/QueenZone.Data/Entities/PrivateMessageEntity.cs`, `PrivateConversationParticipantEntity.cs`). Messages are immutable, so there is no edit/update timestamp to add.
- Account-deletion retention policy is decided and implemented (PR #613, issue #586): private-message bodies and conversation rows are retained for the other participant, sender attribution changes to `Deleted member`, deleted accounts are excluded from recipient search, and conversations cannot receive new replies once either participant has a pending or completed deletion. See `docs/architecture/member-account-deletion.md`.

What remains open, and is the subject of this ADR, is the part #473 explicitly carved out for later: **reported-message retention, moderator access to reported content, and access auditing.** Legal-hold rules are noted as a related concern but are not addressed here (see Non-goals).

The data model for reports already exists ahead of the moderator workflow itself:

- `PrivateMessageReportEntity` (`src/QueenZone.Data/Entities/PrivateMessageReportEntity.cs`) snapshots the reported message body, sender display name, message timestamp, and sort key, plus up to `PrivateMessageLimits.ReportPrecedingMessageCount` messages of preceding context (`PrecedingContextJson`), all captured **at report time**.
- `PrivateMessageReportStatus` (`src/QueenZone.Data/Members/PrivateMessageReportStatus.cs`) defines `Open` → `Reviewed` / `Dismissed` / `Actioned`, with the comment that status transitions are "the moderator review surface (issue #470)."
- `IPrivateMessageRepository` already exposes `CreateReportAsync`, `GetReportAsync`, and `GetReportedMessageIdsAsync`.

No admin/moderator UI or endpoint exists yet to review reports (no `Pages/Admin/Messages` or equivalent) — that is issue #470's scope. This ADR is a prerequisite for #470: it needs to know what it is allowed to retain, show, and must log before it can be built.

The repo has an existing audit-log convention for admin actions: `PhotoAdminAuditLogEntity` (`Id`, `PicId`, `Action`, `ActorEmail`, `OccurredAt`, `Details?`) and its repository `EfNewsAuditRepository`/`EfPhotoAuditRepository`-style siblings. `MemberAccountDeletionAuditLogEntity` is a narrower system-actor variant without an actor-identity field. No audit log exists yet for access to private-message report content.

## Decision

### 1. Report snapshots are the retained record, independent of message lifecycle

The `PrivateMessageReportEntity` snapshot (body, sender name, timestamp, sort key, preceding context) is the durable moderation record. It is captured once, at report time, and is **not** re-synced from the live message afterwards.

- If the underlying `PrivateMessageEntity` or `PrivateConversationEntity` is later deleted for any reason (participant account purge, future user-initiated message deletion, etc.), the report snapshot is **not** deleted alongside it. The report's `Message`/`Conversation` navigation properties may become dangling (no longer resolvable), but `MessageBodySnapshot`, `SenderDisplayNameSnapshot`, `MessageCreatedAtSnapshot`, and `PrecedingContextJson` remain intact and reviewable.
- This makes "permanent deletion" of a message mean *the live conversation copy is gone*, not *all record of it everywhere is gone*. A report already filed against that message keeps its snapshot.

### 2. Reports are retained for a fixed window after resolution, then purged

- Reports in `Open` or `Reviewed` status are retained indefinitely — an open moderation matter is never auto-purged.
- Once a report reaches a terminal status (`Dismissed` or `Actioned`), it is retained for **180 days** after the status change, then eligible for permanent deletion by a background sweep (mirroring the pattern of the existing account-deletion background purge described in `docs/architecture/member-account-deletion.md`).
- This window exists so a dismissed report can still be referenced if the same reported member is reported again, or if an appeal is raised, without keeping message content forever once a matter is closed and the window lapses.
- 180 days is a starting policy value, not a hard architectural constraint; it can be revisited without a new ADR if operational experience shows it should change, but the *mechanism* (indefinite while open, timed purge after terminal status) should not change without amending this ADR.

### 3. Moderator/admin access to reported content is logged

Add `PrivateMessageReportAuditLogEntity`, modeled on `PhotoAdminAuditLogEntity`:

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `long` | Identity |
| `ReportId` | `Guid` | FK to `PrivateMessageReportEntity.Id` |
| `Action` | `string` | `Viewed` or `StatusChanged` (`PrivateMessageReportAuditAction`) |
| `ActorEmail` | `string` | Moderator/admin identity, not a copied member email |
| `OccurredAt` | `DateTimeOffset` | |
| `Details` | `string?` | Old/new status (e.g. `"Open -> Dismissed"`) on a `StatusChanged` row; null on `Viewed` |

- A `Viewed` row is written the first time a moderator opens a given report's content in a session-worthy way (i.e., when the report detail view is loaded), not on every list-page render that merely shows report metadata (reporter, reason, status) without the message body/context.
- `StatusChanged` is written whenever `UpdateReportStatusAsync` actually changes a report's status (a no-op re-save of the same status writes nothing), independent of whether a `Viewed` row exists for that access.
- The audit log itself is retained indefinitely and is not subject to the report purge window in decision 2 — it must outlive the report it references so "who looked at this and when" remains answerable even after the underlying report is purged. `ReportId` is therefore not a strict FK requiring cascade delete; deleting a purged report does not delete its audit trail.
- Implemented end to end: the moderator review surface at `/admin/private-messages` (issue #470) calls `AppendReportViewedAuditAsync` on detail-page load and `UpdateReportStatusAsync` on status change, so a status transition and its audit row are written atomically in the same repository call and can never happen without each other.

### 4. User-facing labels

Any UI or copy describing message/report deletion (member-facing "delete this message," admin-facing "delete report") must not claim content is immediately and completely erased when it is instead retained per decisions 1–2. Use language consistent with the account-deletion feature's existing pattern (`docs/architecture/member-account-deletion.md`): describe what becomes hidden/inaccessible to the member versus what is retained and for how long, rather than a bare "deleted."

## Non-goals

- **Legal hold.** No legal-hold mechanism (a flag that suspends the decision-2 purge window for a report under litigation/subpoena) is designed here. If a legal-hold requirement materializes, it should extend decision 2 (e.g., an `IsOnLegalHold` flag on the report that blocks the sweep) via an amendment to this ADR rather than inventing a parallel mechanism.
- **Global private-message browsing for admins.** The moderator surface (`/admin/private-messages`, issue #470) only ever loads reports and the snapshotted content attached to them — there is no admin capability to browse or search private messages outside of a filed report. That would need a separate explicit policy and its own ADR amendment.
- **Per-message (as opposed to per-conversation) archive/delete state for ordinary, non-reported messages.** Out of scope for #473; today's per-user state is conversation-level (decision already shipped, see Context).

## Consequences

Benefits:

- The moderator review surface at `/admin/private-messages` (issue #470) has a settled data contract it builds against: what a report retains, for how long, and what must be logged when a moderator views it.
- Report content survives independent message/account deletion, so moderation and appeals remain possible without depending on live conversation state.
- The audit table follows an established repo convention (`PhotoAdminAuditLogEntity`-style), so it fits existing `EfNewsAuditRepository`-style repository patterns and doesn't introduce a new logging approach.
- Status changes and their audit rows are written in the same repository call (`UpdateReportStatusAsync`), so the moderator UI cannot accidentally change a report's status without producing a matching audit entry.

Tradeoffs:

- Report snapshots mean a reported message's content can outlive the sender's or recipient's decision to delete their account or (in the future) delete the message itself. This is an intentional retained-for-moderation carve-out and should be reflected in user-facing copy per decision 4, not treated as a bug.
- The 180-day terminal-status purge window requires a background sweep job, similar in shape to the existing account-deletion purge service, adding one more scheduled job to operate and monitor.
- The audit log survives report purges by design, so `ReportId` referential integrity is soft (application-enforced), not database-enforced via cascade delete — this must be handled deliberately in the EF mapping (no cascade delete configured from report to audit log).
