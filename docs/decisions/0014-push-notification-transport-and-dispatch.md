# ADR 0014: Push Notification Transport And Dispatch Model

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

[Epic #756](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/756) needs the backend to actually deliver push notifications for forum replies, private messages, and news to iOS and Android devices ([#757](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/757)–[#760](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/760)). Two decisions were left open by those stories:

1. **Transport** — how the backend gets a message to a device: through Apple's and Google's push services directly, or through a third-party relay.
2. **Dispatch mechanism** — how sending is wired into the existing forum-post, message-send, and news-publish write paths ([#759](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/759)) without a queue or worker infrastructure this project doesn't otherwise have.

Constraints already set elsewhere in the repo:

- [ADR 0011](0011-mobile-project-location-and-build-tooling.md) explicitly declined Expo Application Services (EAS) — "No Expo account, EAS project owner, or EAS-hosted credential store is required." Expo's push notification service is normally paired with an EAS project, so using it here would cut against that decision.
- [`hosting-scale-and-cache.md`](../architecture/hosting-scale-and-cache.md) commits to a single B1 App Service instance with no Redis, no queue, and no autoscaling, and says to "assume single instance in all performance and caching designs" until that document is updated.
- The product owner has confirmed push delivery is **best-effort with no retry** — a failed send is logged (per #760) and dropped, not requeued.
- There is no existing precedent in this codebase for an async, decoupled dispatch-after-write pattern (no email sender, no message queue); the only `BackgroundService`s in the repo are periodic sweeps (`GalleryOrphanSweepHostedService`, `MemberAccountDeletionHostedService`, `SearchIndexSeedHostedService`), not per-request work queues.
- Credentials for third-party providers already follow a documented pattern: Bitwarden Secrets Manager as the source of truth, synced into App Service settings, named `Category__Key` (e.g. `Authentication__Discord__ClientSecret`, `Analytics__GoogleAnalyticsServiceAccountJson`) — see [ADR 0008](0008-app-service-settings-ownership.md) and [`opentofu-inventory.md`](../architecture/opentofu-inventory.md).

## Decision

### 1. Transport: call APNs and FCM directly

The backend calls Apple's and Google's push endpoints directly. It does not send through Expo's push notification service.

- **APNs** — Apple's HTTP/2 provider API (`api.sandbox.push.apple.com` for development/TestFlight builds, `api.push.apple.com` for production), authenticated with a token-based APNs Auth Key: an ES256 JWT signed with a `.p8` private key, `kid` = Key ID, `iss` = Team ID. Apple allows reusing one signed token for up to roughly an hour, so the provider does not need to sign a fresh JWT per notification.
- **FCM** — Google's HTTP v1 API (`https://fcm.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project-id}/messages:send`), authenticated with an OAuth2 access token minted from a Firebase service-account JSON.
- Generating and storing these credentials is its own explicit step per platform, tracked separately from this ADR: the APNs Auth Key (distinct from the code-signing credential already wired up for TestFlight in [#808](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/808)), and the Firebase project + service account for FCM. Both follow the existing Bitwarden → App Service settings convention:
  - `PushNotifications__Apns__TeamId`, `PushNotifications__Apns__KeyId`, `PushNotifications__Apns__PrivateKeyPem`, `PushNotifications__Apns__Environment` (`sandbox` / `production`)
  - `PushNotifications__Fcm__ServiceAccountJson`, `PushNotifications__Fcm__ProjectId`
- Rationale: ADR 0011 already ruled out EAS-hosted credential management for this solo-maintained project. Going direct keeps the new dependency surface to outbound HTTPS calls and two sets of self-owned credentials — nothing hosted by a third party sits between this app and Apple/Google, and nothing here requires an EAS project to exist.
- No specific NuGet package is mandated. Implement with `HttpClient` plus a JWT library already available in the ecosystem (e.g. `System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt`) for the APNs token, or a small maintained client if one meaningfully reduces boilerplate — but it must not depend on EAS or Expo's hosted push relay.

### 2. Dispatch: synchronous, in-process, best-effort, no retry

Notification dispatch happens **inline, awaited, at the end of the existing write path** (forum reply save, message send, news publish) — not on a background queue or worker.

**Volume reasoning**, since this is what makes synchronous dispatch reliable rather than a corner cut:

| Event | Typical fan-out | Why synchronous is fine |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private message send | 1 recipient | Single HTTP call; negligible latency. |
| Forum reply (topic followers) | Low tens, at this forum's scale | A handful of concurrent HTTP calls; sub-second. |
| News publish (opted-in subscribers) | The largest fan-out, bounded by total opted-in members | Use each provider's batch shape — FCM's HTTP v1 batching (up to 500 tokens per call) in one request, and concurrent APNs HTTP/2 requests over one shared `HttpClient`/`SocketsHttpHandler` connection, bounded by a `SemaphoreSlim` cap (recommended: ~20 concurrent). This completes in well under a second at hobby-scale membership and adds negligible latency to the write's response. |

Explicitly **not** doing, for the initial implementation:

- **A background queue** (`Channel<T>` + `BackgroundService`, or any external queue product). Real complexity — consumer lifetime, shutdown draining, DI scope handling — not justified at current or reasonably foreseeable volume, and not required to meet the "never block or fail the write" requirement in #759 as long as the dispatch call itself is wrapped in try/catch and never rethrows.
- **Detached `Task.Run` fire-and-forget.** A task detached from the request loses safe access to scoped services (`DbContext`, preference lookups) unless a manual `IServiceScopeFactory` scope is created, and risks an unobserved exception escaping the #760 logging path. Inline `await` inside a try/catch is simpler, easier to reason about, and no slower in practice at these volumes.
- **Retry/backoff.** A provider error (timeout, 5xx, network failure) is caught at the call site, logged per #760 with enough context to diagnose (member id, category, provider error — no token), and the notification is dropped. This is acceptable specifically because retry was explicitly waived as a requirement; it is a deliberate scope cut, not an oversight.

**Escalation trigger** (revisit later, do not build now): if a single event's recipient count regularly exceeds roughly 500, or the added write-path latency becomes noticeable in practice, move to an in-process bounded `Channel<T>` + `BackgroundService` consumer. That is still single-instance-safe and needs no new Azure resource — consistent with `hosting-scale-and-cache.md`'s posture of staying process-local until traffic actually justifies more. Do not reach for a hosted queue (Service Bus, etc.) without updating that document first, for the same reason Redis is off the table today.

## Consequences

Benefits:

- No new hosted dependency (no EAS project, no third-party push relay) — consistent with ADR 0011 and this project's solo-maintainer, low-budget posture.
- No new runtime infrastructure (no queue, no extra `BackgroundService`) — consistent with `hosting-scale-and-cache.md`'s single-instance assumption.
- Simple to reason about: a failed send is caught, logged, and dropped, matching the already-agreed best-effort/no-retry bar exactly, with no partial-delivery or duplicate-delivery edge cases a retry mechanism would introduce.

Tradeoffs:

- The write request's latency includes push dispatch time. Bounded and small at current volumes (see table above), but a genuine cost that a fully decoupled design wouldn't have.
- A transient provider outage or timeout silently drops that notification permanently — by design, but worth remembering when triaging "a member says they didn't get notified."
- If News subscriber counts or a single topic's follower count grow well beyond hobby scale, this design needs the escalation step above; it is not infinitely scalable by construction.
