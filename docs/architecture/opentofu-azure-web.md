# OpenTofu Azure web import

Issue: [#622](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/622),
step 4 of epic [#615](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/615).

## Managed boundary

The production root declares imports for:

- resource group `Queenzone-RG`;
- Linux App Service plan `ASP-Queenzone`, fixed at B1 and one worker;
- Linux web app `queenzone-dev` and its system-assigned identity;
- `queenzone.org` and `www.queenzone.org` SNI hostname bindings;
- Log Analytics workspace `queenzone-dev-law`;
- Application Insights component `queenzone-dev-ai`.

No direct role assignment exists for the web app identity, so this module does
not invent one. ADR 0008 keeps App Service settings outside OpenTofu. The narrow
`ignore_changes` entry prevents an incomplete settings map from deleting live
secrets or the ARM-owned deployment settings.

The live main-site restriction remains Cloudflare allow-only with deny-all.
SCM retains a separate allow-all policy for the current deployment workflow.
AzureRM 5.0.1 normalises both explicit terminal rules to empty default-action
fields during import; #626 now sets `ip_restriction_default_action = "Deny"`
and `scm_ip_restriction_default_action = "Allow"` explicitly so a plan cannot
silently open the origin or lock out SCM. The Cloudflare allow ranges remain
managed alongside them.

## Certificate boundary

The two certificates are uploaded GeoTrust PFX resources expiring
**2026-12-29**. They are not Key Vault or App Service Managed Certificates.
AzureRM cannot safely describe them without private PFX material, and the
renewal path is unresolved. OpenTofu therefore manages the SNI hostname
bindings and current certificate thumbprints but not the certificate resources.
This keeps certificate secrets out of configuration and state.

## Verification

On **2026-08-15**, the protected remote state was read and a production plan
was generated without applying it. All seven declared import addresses were
`no-op`; no create, update, replace, or delete was proposed.

Read-only live checks also passed:

- `scripts/Smoke-LiveSite.ps1` passed `/warmup`, GET `/health`, and all public routes;
- direct GET `https://queenzone-dev.azurewebsites.net/health` returned 403;
- the SCM API endpoint remained reachable;
- Application Insights contained 499 requests in the preceding hour, with the latest at `2026-08-15T04:44:35Z`.

The plan file and provider state can contain sensitive values. Keep them outside
the repository and report only resource actions during review.
