# Dev Azure environment

## Current status: 2026-09-05

The infrastructure, DNS, managed TLS, runtime settings, and automatic
application deployment are live. Qualifying web merges to `main` deploy the
tested CI artifact through `deploy-dev.yml`; recent runs have passed artifact
resolution, deployment, warmup, and public/API smoke at
`https://dev.queenzone.org`.

Dev uses deterministic sample data until the approval-gated curated refresh in
[`dev-curated-snapshot.md`](dev-curated-snapshot.md) passes. The refresh then
sets `DEV_SNAPSHOT_READY=true`; later `deploy-dev.yml` runs retain and migrate
the verified dev-only database. Infrastructure provisioned the targets, but a
merged workflow alone is not proof that the first data refresh has run.

Mobile staging still points at production until #1270. Production remains in
`australiaeast` under its historical `queenzone-dev` resource name until #1272.

Phase 1 of epic #1264, issue #1265. The new root is
`infra/environments/dev`; its backend uses `dev.tfstate` in the existing
protected state container. Production retains `production.tfstate`.
No production resource or import address moves. Resource labels inside the
shared web module still say `production` to preserve existing state addresses;
the dev root's separate state and explicit names determine the actual target.

## Provisioning evidence: 2026-09-04

[PR #1300](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/pull/1300) merged
with required checks passing. After the maintainer approved the names and scoped
CI access, an operator applied the one-resource dev group bootstrap. The
[dev-only workflow](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/actions/runs/33847788695)
then planned four creates, applied that exact reviewed artifact through the
existing approval gate, and passed its HTTPS smoke check.

Azure CLI verified `queenzone-devbox` is Running on `ASP-Queenzone-Dev` in
`Queenzone-Dev-RG`, Australia East: B1, one worker, Always On, .NET 10,
TLS 1.2 and HTTPS-only. A direct HTTPS request returned HTTP 200 and the
Microsoft Azure App Service welcome page. A fresh dev plan against remote state
returned exit code 0: no creates, updates, deletes or replacements.

Production remained Running on `ASP-Queenzone` in `Queenzone-RG`, B1/one worker.
The duplicate all-roots push workflow was cancelled before apply, so the deleted
DNS record was not recreated. This paragraph records Phase 1 evidence only;
the current state is summarised above.

## Resources and boundaries

All five resources are new, in Australia East:

| Resource | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Resource group | Queenzone-Dev-RG |
| Linux B1 plan, one worker | ASP-Queenzone-Dev |
| Always-on .NET 10 web app | queenzone-devbox |
| Log Analytics, 30-day retention, 0.1 GB daily cap | queenzone-devbox-law |
| Workspace-linked Application Insights | queenzone-devbox-ai |

The shared module preserves health checks, TLS, logging, Cloudflare ranges,
identity and lifecycle protection. B1 and one worker remain enforced for both
callers. Production's default hostnames and ingress cannot be relaxed by the
new dev options. Dev initially permits direct access to its Azure HTTPS
hostname. This originally exposed only Azure's empty-app placeholder. Phase 4
now deploys the application automatically. No production settings, databases
or blobs are copied.
`WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH=/health` is seeded at creation; subsequent settings remain
operator/deployment-owned under the existing ignore_changes boundary. Application
Insights runtime wiring belongs with those settings in Phase 4.

## DNS and managed TLS history

`enable_custom_domain` defaults to false. Phase 1 creates no hostname binding
or certificate because DNS has not been pointed at this app. The maintainer
reported deleting the old dev DNS record on 2026-09-04; this does not prove
that the Static Web App itself has been decommissioned.

Phase 3 (#1267) decommissioned the APK site, set the CNAME directly
to `queenzone-devbox.azurewebsites.net`, publish Azure's ownership TXT value
where required, and enabled the custom-domain option in committed HCL.
That created the hostname binding, Azure-managed certificate and SNI binding.
Keep dev ingress direct: the CNAME must remain DNS-only for Azure-managed
certificate issuance and renewal, so Cloudflare-only ingress is not compatible
with this certificate choice. Production retains its Cloudflare-only ingress.
The resulting hostname and certificate are live and verified.

Managed certificates require no supplied PFX/private key, so they avoid the
production uploaded-certificate exception. Azure requires a direct CNAME for
subdomains; an intermediate CNAME or Cloudflare proxy can prevent issuance or
renewal. Review the permanent DNS/proxy arrangement in Phase 3 before switching
on TLS, including renewal, rather than merely passing initial issuance.
See [Azure certificate requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate)
and [AzureRM managed certificates](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/5.0.1/docs/resources/app_service_managed_certificate).

The production root owns the `dev.queenzone.org` DNS record; the dev root owns
the App Service hostname and certificate. The apply workflow serialises those
roots when both change and still permits an independently reviewed dev-only
apply.

## First-use permissions and approval

Initial RBAC inspection on 2026-09-04 found both CI identities scoped to
production only. The approved bootstrap below has now been completed: the dev
group exists and both identities have the listed dev-scoped roles. Do not repeat
the bootstrap for routine applies or grant subscription-wide Contributor.

Because a resource group must exist before resource-group-scoped assignments
can be made, the first bootstrap needs an authorised operator:

1. Confirm the names above and review the full dev plan: five creates only.
2. With explicit approval, use OpenTofu to create **only** the resource group
   in the dev backend. This is a one-time targeted bootstrap, not an Azure CLI
   creation/import or a routine partial apply:

   ```powershell
   tofu '-chdir=infra/environments/dev' init -reconfigure '-backend-config=../../backend/dev.backend.hcl'
   tofu '-chdir=infra/environments/dev' plan '-target=azurerm_resource_group.dev' "-out=$env:TEMP/queenzone-dev-rg.tfplan"
   # Review before applying this exact one-create plan.
   tofu '-chdir=infra/environments/dev' apply "$env:TEMP/queenzone-dev-rg.tfplan"
   ```

3. An authorised RBAC administrator assigns the plan identity
   `859329f3-afcb-4c17-9201-ee21120cfa0d` **Reader** plus the existing
   **QueenZone OpenTofu Plan - App Service Config Reader** custom role on
   `/subscriptions/610e3b3a-028d-4f1b-ac1d-a5567a4f8b9d/resourceGroups/Queenzone-Dev-RG`.
   Assign **Contributor** to apply identity
   `7b466caa-bd0e-4bee-b77f-c9b715fbd36e` on that same group only.
   Confirm the custom role's assignable scopes include this group before use.
   Existing state-container access already covers the separate dev key.
4. Regenerate the full plan through `opentofu-apply.yml`, choosing `root: dev`
   when production drift remains. Review the four remaining creates and approve
   the protected `opentofu-apply` job. The exact checked plan artifact is applied.
   These bootstrap steps were completed on 2026-09-04 after maintainer approval;
   routine applies now use the existing resource group and assignments.

The PR plan uses `pull_request_target`, whose workflow definition comes from
main. Therefore this PR cannot automatically exercise its new dev matrix until
that definition is merged. Use the local read-only dev plan as pre-merge evidence;
verify the new PR matrix on the next infra PR. Do not claim that local operator
access proves the CI identity permissions.

## Verification and completion

Run `./scripts/Test-OpenTofu.ps1` for both roots, or pass
`-EnvironmentName dev`. It checks formatting, credentials, lifecycle protection,
initialisation, validation, and mocked shared-module contract tests. Mock tests
never contact Azure. A real plan must also pass `Test-OpenTofuPlanSafety.ps1`.

For infrastructure changes, verify both roots with `Test-OpenTofu.ps1`, review
the approval-gated plan, and confirm the live target after apply. For
application changes, confirm the automatic `deploy-dev.yml` run, build stamp,
warmup, and route smoke at `https://dev.queenzone.org`. Infrastructure merge,
apply, application deploy, and live verification remain separate completion
states.
