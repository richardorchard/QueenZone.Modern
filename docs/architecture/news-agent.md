# News Agent

The news agent discovers public Queen-related stories from configured sources, triages them with OpenRouter, generates editor-reviewable drafts, and places results in an admin review queue. It does **not** publish to visitor-facing pages automatically.

- `docs/architecture/news-agent-editorial-rules.md` — trust tiers, source registry, relevance scope, and safety rules
- `docs/architecture/automated-news-discovery-plan.md` — original architecture plan

## Pipeline

```text
Configured sources (RSS / sitemap / allowlisted pages)
  → fetch + dedupe → NewsCandidate records
  → AI triage (relevance, confidence, duplicates)
  → AI draft generation (for needs-review candidates)
  → admin review queue (/admin/news-discovery)
  → promote to admin news draft → editor publish (existing /admin/news workflow)
```

Public `/news` shows only published articles. Promoted discovery drafts remain hidden until an editor publishes them through admin news.

## Repository layout

```text
src/
  QueenZone.NewsAgent/           # discovery, triage, drafting, OpenRouter client
  QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker/    # console worker (discover-news command)
  QueenZone.Data/                # discovery tables, repositories, workflow rules
  QueenZone.Web/Pages/Admin/
    News/                        # manual news editorial workflow
    NewsDiscovery/               # discovery candidate + draft review queue
```

Source registry: `src/QueenZone.NewsAgent/news-discovery-sources.json` (seeded into the database with `--seed-sources`).

## Local setup

### Database

The worker persists candidates, AI runs, and drafts through `QueenZone.Data`. For real data, set `ConnectionStrings:QueenZoneLegacy` in the worker local settings file (see below). Without a connection string, the worker uses in-memory sample data (useful for quick runs, not for reviewing real discoveries).

The web app's admin review queue reads the same discovery tables when the site is configured with the same database connection.

### OpenRouter API key (one-time)

Copy the example secrets file:

```powershell
copy src\QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker\appsettings.Local.json.example src\QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker\appsettings.Local.json
```

Edit `src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker/appsettings.Local.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "QueenZoneLegacy": ""
  },
  "OpenRouter": {
    "ApiKey": "sk-or-v1-..."
  }
}
```

That file is git-ignored. The worker copies it to the build output automatically. You can also set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment.

Fetch-only discovery works without an API key. Triage and drafting require a key (or `--dry-run`).

### Budget and model defaults

Configured in `src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker/appsettings.json` under `OpenRouter`, `NewsTriage`, and `NewsDraftGeneration`. Defaults include per-run and daily spend caps.

## Worker commands

```powershell
dotnet run --project src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker -- discover-news [options]
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--seed-sources` | Upsert sources from `news-discovery-sources.json` |
| `--fetch-only` | Fetch feeds only (no AI) |
| `--triage` | Run AI triage after fetch |
| `--triage-only` | Triage existing `Discovered` candidates only |
| `--draft` | Generate drafts after fetch/triage |
| `--draft-only` | Draft existing `NeedsReview` candidates only |
| `--scheduled` | Preset for automation: `--seed-sources --triage --draft` |
| `--dry-run` | Log AI steps without calling OpenRouter or persisting status changes |
| `--force` | Bypass source poll-interval skip; force draft regeneration where applicable |

Examples:

```powershell
# Seed sources and fetch new items
dotnet run --project src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker -- discover-news --seed-sources

# Full local pipeline: fetch, triage, draft
dotnet run --project src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker -- discover-news --seed-sources --triage --draft

# Re-run triage on candidates already in the database
dotnet run --project src/QueenZone.NewsAgent.Worker -- discover-news --triage-only
```

## Scheduled runs

For Task Scheduler, Azure Container Apps Jobs, Functions, or WebJobs, see **`docs/architecture/news-agent-scheduling.md`**.

Quick local scheduled preset:

```powershell
scripts/Run-NewsAgentDiscovery.ps1 -Scheduled
```

Overlapping runs are skipped via a database lease (`NewsAgentScheduler` in worker `appsettings.json`). Use `--force` to bypass the lease for manual reruns.

## OpenRouter smoke test (Windows)

Double-click `scripts/Smoke-NewsAgent.bat` or run it from a terminal. The script:

1. Checks that `appsettings.Local.json` exists with a real API key
2. Runs fetch (`--seed-sources`)
3. Runs triage (`--triage-only`)

Pass criteria: triage completes with `failures=0` and log lines such as `OpenRouter completed`. Some feed fetch errors are common and do not fail the smoke test if triage succeeds.

## Admin review queue

Authenticated admins use Razor Pages under `/admin/news-discovery`:

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/admin/news-discovery` | Filterable list (status, source, trust tier, confidence, entity, dates, has-draft) |
| `/admin/news-discovery/{id}` | Candidate detail: source URL, evidence, AI rationale, draft fields |
| `/admin/news-discovery/{id}/edit-draft` | Edit generated draft fields |

Editor actions (POST, anti-forgery protected):

- **Mark not relevant** → `Rejected`
- **Ignore duplicate** → `IgnoredDuplicate`
- **Edit draft** → save fields; moves `NeedsReview` → `Drafted` when appropriate
- **Promote to admin news** → creates an unpublished article in `/admin/news` and marks the candidate `PromotedToArticle`

Link from **Admin news** (`/admin/news`) → “Review discovered candidates”.

Regenerating a draft: use **Regenerate draft with AI** on the candidate review page (requires `OpenRouter:ApiKey` in `src/QueenZone.Web/appsettings.Local.json` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`), or run the worker with `--draft-only` / `--force`.

### Admin authentication

Admin routes require sign-in plus an email listed in `Admin:AllowedEmails`.

- **Production:** Microsoft Entra ID (`AzureAd:*` settings). See `README.md` → Admin authentication.
- **Local dev without Entra:** set `AzureAd:ClientId` to `""` in `src/QueenZone.Web/appsettings.Local.json` and send the `X-Test-User-Email` header with an allowed admin email. Automated tests use this path. There is no separate admin password login; member OAuth at `/account/login` does not grant admin access.

## Implementation status (News Agent MVP)

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| #99 Source registry | Done | `news-discovery-sources.json` + `news-agent-editorial-rules.md` |
| #100 Data model | Done | Discovery tables + repositories in `QueenZone.Data` |
| #101 Fetchers + worker | Done | RSS, sitemap, allowlisted pages; `discover-news` command |
| #102 OpenRouter client | Done | Budget guard, model defaults, AI run logging |
| #103 AI triage | Done | Structured triage + deterministic duplicate checks |
| #104 Draft generation | Done | Citations/attribution; `--draft` flags |
| #105 Admin review queue | Done | `/admin/news-discovery` + in-admin regenerate draft |
| #106 Promote workflow | Done | Provenance panel on admin news, richer promote audit, bidirectional links |
| #107 Scheduled hosting | Done | DB run lease, `--scheduled`, `Run-NewsAgentDiscovery.ps1`, scheduling doc |
| #108 Tests/observability | Done | Run summary telemetry, failure-mode tests, test matrix in docs |

## Observability

Each `discover-news` run emits a structured **`NewsAgentRunCompleted`** log event (event id `4100`) with fetch, triage, draft, failure, and estimated AI spend totals. Step-level logs (`Discovery finished`, `Triage finished`, `Draft generation finished`) remain for troubleshooting.

Search application logs for `NewsAgentRunCompleted` or `EventId=4100` when monitoring scheduled runs.

## Test matrix

| Layer | Default CI | Opt-in manual |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| Source fetchers | Fake HTTP fixtures | `scripts/Smoke-NewsAgent.bat` (live feeds) |
| OpenRouter triage/draft | Fake `INewsAiClient` | `Smoke-NewsAgent.bat` + real API key |
| Admin review / no auto-publish | Web integration tests | — |
| Failure modes (malformed AI, disabled key) | `NewsAgentFailureModeTests` | — |
| Legacy SQL discovery tables | In-memory / SQLite tests | Real DB migration apply |

Report in pull requests whether opt-in smoke and legacy database checks were run or skipped.

## Testing

Default CI tests use fake fetchers and fake AI clients. They do not call OpenRouter or live RSS feeds.

Before a pull request touching the news agent:

```powershell
dotnet restore QueenZone.sln
dotnet build QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-restore
dotnet test QueenZone.sln --configuration Release --no-build
```

Report in the PR whether manual smoke tests (`scripts/Smoke-NewsAgent.bat`) and real legacy database checks were run or skipped.
