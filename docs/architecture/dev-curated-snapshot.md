# Dev curated snapshot

Issue [#1325](https://github.com/richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern/issues/1325)
defines the isolated dev data contract. Dev uses a small, sanitised production
sample. It is not a production clone.

## Safety boundary

The refresh has four separate credentials:

| Credential | Required scope |
| --- | --- |
| `DEV_SNAPSHOT_SOURCE_SQL_READONLY` | `SELECT` and schema inspection on `queenzone-db`; no insert, update, delete, execute-as-owner, or DDL rights |
| `DEV_SNAPSHOT_TARGET_SQL` | schema and data writes on `queenzone-dev-db` only |
| `DEV_SNAPSHOT_SOURCE_BLOB_READONLY` | account SAS for production Blob Storage with service `b`, resource types needed for list/read, and permissions exactly `rl` |
| `DEV_SNAPSHOT_TARGET_BLOB` | read/write/delete on `queenzonedev` only |

The tool checks the SQL database names and rejects database- or object-level
mutation, DDL/control, or stored-procedure execution rights on production. It
also rejects source Blob account keys or write-capable SAS permissions and
requires the target storage account name `queenzonedev`.
Application runtime credentials are separate. The dev app receives only the dev
SQL and Blob connection strings.

Store the credentials and two generated synthetic-account passwords in the
`Queenzone Development` Bitwarden Secrets Manager project. Map them through the
repository variable `BITWARDEN_DEV_SNAPSHOT_SECRETS` to the six snapshot names
used by `.github/workflows/refresh-dev-snapshot.yml`, plus the existing
`SIXLABORS_LICENSE_KEY` needed to build the refresh tooling. Do not reuse the
production App Service connection string as the read-only source credential.

Protect the `dev-data-refresh` GitHub environment with a required reviewer,
then set repository variable `DEV_SNAPSHOT_APPROVAL_GATE_CONFIGURED=true`.
The workflow fails before secrets or cloud access when that explicit setup flag
is absent. It also requires the operator to type `REFRESH DEV SNAPSHOT`.

The environment uses the same narrowly scoped Azure identity as `dev-deploy`.
Copy its `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, and `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment
variables to `dev-data-refresh`, then add one federated credential to the
`QueenZone Dev Deploy` Entra application with subject
`repo:richardorchard/QueenZone.Modern:environment:dev-data-refresh`. Do not add
or widen an Azure role: the existing Website Contributor assignment on
`queenzone-devbox` is sufficient. The four isolated SQL and Blob credentials,
not this identity, perform the snapshot data work.

## What is selected

Selection rules live in [`config/dev-snapshot.json`](../../config/dev-snapshot.json).
Small public archive/reference tables are copied in full. Tables with mixed
public/private columns use explicit projections:

- `NEWS_T` and `EditorialArticles` retain published content but replace editor emails.
- `FREDDIE_T.Email` and `Q_STAGE_T.CONTACT` are cleared.
- only referenced `USERS_T` rows are copied; password, email, IP, birth date,
  profile, contact, and transfer fields are cleared or replaced.
- only `MemberAccounts` referenced by sampled forum content are copied; email,
  password hashes, avatars, moderation actor emails, and recovery fields are
  cleared or replaced.
- external logins, auth grants, private messages, mailing lists, IP/security
  data, submissions, tokens, operational queues, and audit rows remain empty.

Forum selection is deterministic and relationally complete. It includes every
category; old, middle, and recent threads; sticky and hidden threads when those
states exist; and short, medium, and large threads. Each chosen thread brings
all posts, stored attachment rows, poll definitions, and required authors. The
known public forum-guidelines topic is included for smoke testing. Production's
current `ModernForumThread` schema has no persisted lock column, so the snapshot
cannot truthfully select a locked source row; lock behaviour remains covered by
synthetic application tests until that state is persisted.

Photo candidates are spread deterministically across every public category.
Only rows whose original and thumbnail blobs exist and fit the budget are
loaded. Gallery pictures referenced by news are mandatory. Blob references from
sampled forum posts and published editorial content are also mandatory.

`SearchDocument` is never copied. The search worker rebuilds it from the loaded
snapshot.

The two synthetic accounts are `admin@dev.queenzone.invalid` and
`member@dev.queenzone.invalid`. Their generated passwords are separate
Bitwarden secrets. The workflow adds only the synthetic admin address to the
dev allowlist; no production credential or external-login identifier is used.

## Limits

- database used space after migrations and search rebuild: **1,536 MB**
- initial forum ceiling: **150,000 posts**
- automatic size retry: **100,000 posts**
- gallery originals and thumbnails: **500 MB**
- forum attachments: **500 MB**

The checked-in config owns these values. A refresh fails before the app is
connected when any limit, privacy rule, required-table check, category coverage
check, or relationship check fails.

## Workflow

Run **Refresh dev curated snapshot** manually. It performs these stages:

1. set App Service `DevSnapshot__Ready=false` and remove the dev database setting;
2. extract a schema-only DACPAC from production;
3. publish the production-compatible schema to `queenzone-dev-db`, excluding
   the known broken legacy views;
4. select, sanitise, and stream curated rows to dev;
5. clear dev Blob Storage and copy only the generated manifest;
6. seed synthetic password accounts;
7. apply current EF migrations;
8. rebuild `SearchDocument`;
9. enforce size, privacy, relationship, content, and Blob guards;
10. connect the dev-only SQL and Blob settings;
11. run readiness/public-route smoke plus read-only browser/API journeys;
12. set App Service `DevSnapshot__Ready=true`, allowing future `deploy-dev.yml`
    runs to migrate and retain the verified snapshot, then repeat public-route
    smoke after the resulting App Service restart.

The workflow uploads only `summary.json` for 30 days. It does not upload the
full manifest because forum filenames may contain user-supplied text. Logs and
artifacts never contain connection strings, SAS tokens, passwords, email
addresses, or account keys.

On any failure, the final handler removes the database connection and leaves
the public dev site on deterministic sample data. A partial database or Blob
load is never connected to the app.

## Local equivalent

Load the six environment variables from Bitwarden without printing them. Review
the boundaries first:

```powershell
./scripts/Import-SixLaborsLicense.ps1
./scripts/Refresh-DevSnapshot.ps1
```

After approval, run:

```powershell
./scripts/Refresh-DevSnapshot.ps1 -Apply
```

The local script does not change App Service settings. Connecting the resulting
snapshot and running live smoke remains an explicit operator action. Prefer the
approval-gated workflow for the real refresh.

## Operational checks

Record the summary artifact, workflow run, selected forum/post/photo counts,
database size, and Blob totals for each refresh. Before and after counts on
production remain unchanged by construction because both source credentials are
read-only; investigate any permission-boundary failure instead of bypassing it.

After connection, verify `/health/ready`, `/`, `/news`, `/articles`,
`/photography`, `/forum`, the sampled forum-guidelines topic, `/search`,
`/api/v1`, and content list/detail APIs. The workflow's Playwright checks must
also show sampled photography assets resolving from
`queenzonedev.blob.core.windows.net`, never a production Blob origin.
