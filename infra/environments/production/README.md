# QueenZone production OpenTofu root

This root module is the only production entry point. The resource group,
Azure web/telemetry estate, Azure data estate, and Cloudflare edge estate all
use declarative import blocks from #622, #628, and #626.

The first remote plan must show imports and no unexplained change, replacement,
or deletion. Do not apply from a local operator session. The protected
`opentofu-apply` environment remains the only apply path.

Use [`scripts/Test-OpenTofu.ps1`](../../../scripts/Test-OpenTofu.ps1) for local validation. See [`docs/architecture/opentofu-contributor-runbook.md`](../../../docs/architecture/opentofu-contributor-runbook.md) before planning, importing, moving state, or applying.

## Phase 7 staged migration

Issue #1272 moves production to `canadaeast` while retaining the imported
`australiaeast` estate for a rollback window. The target owns the production
hostnames and uses Cloudflare-only ingress after Stage 4. The old web and data
resources remain protected until the observation gates permit retirement.

The SQL administrator password comes from the existing Bitwarden migration
connection-string secret. OpenTofu passes it through the AzureRM provider's
write-only field; it is ephemeral and cannot enter the plan or state.

Follow
[`production-region-migration.md`](../../../docs/architecture/production-region-migration.md)
for the phased apply, copy, verification, cutover, and retirement gates.
