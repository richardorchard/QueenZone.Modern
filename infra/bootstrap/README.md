# OpenTofu state bootstrap

This directory owns the one-time control plane for QueenZone OpenTofu state. It is deliberately separate from the future production stack, so that stack never needs to create the backend that stores its own state.

Run from an authenticated operator workstation:

```powershell
az account set --subscription 610e3b3a-028d-4f1b-ac1d-a5567a4f8b9d
./infra/bootstrap/Bootstrap-OpenTofuState.ps1 -WhatIf
./infra/bootstrap/Bootstrap-OpenTofuState.ps1
./infra/bootstrap/Test-OpenTofuState.ps1
```

The bootstrap is idempotent. It creates or verifies:

- `Queenzone-IaC-RG` in Australia East;
- private container `tfstate` in `queenzonetfstate`;
- Entra-only blob access, TLS 1.2, blob versioning, 30-day blob/container soft delete, and a `CanNotDelete` lock;
- separate `QueenZone OpenTofu Plan` and `QueenZone OpenTofu Apply` Entra applications;
- GitHub environment OIDC credentials for `opentofu-plan` and `opentofu-apply`;
- container-scoped state access, Reader plus a minimal custom `config/list` role for plan, and resource-group-scoped Contributor for apply;
- protected-branch-only GitHub environments, with `opentofu-apply` requiring approval.

The script does not create Cloudflare tokens, import application resources, or run an OpenTofu apply against production resources.

See [`docs/architecture/opentofu-state-and-identity.md`](../../docs/architecture/opentofu-state-and-identity.md) for recovery, rotation, and Cloudflare token controls.
