# QueenZone.Mobile

Expo development-build client for QueenZone. Android and iOS are equal
supported platforms. This project is not part of `QueenZone.sln`.

Decisions: [ADR 0009](../../docs/decisions/0009-react-native-for-mobile-app.md),
[ADR 0011](../../docs/decisions/0011-mobile-project-location-and-build-tooling.md),
[ADR 0012](../../docs/decisions/0012-react-navigation-app-shell.md).
Host toolchain: [mobile development environment](../../docs/mobile-development-environment.md).

## Pinned versions

| Tool | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Expo SDK | **57** (`expo@~57.0.15`) |
| React Native | **0.86.2** |
| Node.js | **24 LTS** (`>=24 <25`) |
| npm | Bundled with Node.js |
| JDK | **17** (Eclipse Temurin) |
| Android `compileSdk` / `targetSdk` | **36** (from Expo SDK 57) |
| Android SDK Build-Tools | **36.0.0** |
| Xcode | **26.4+** (SDK 57 requirement) |
| Application id | `org.queenzone.mobile` |

Expo Go is **not** a supported build or test environment. Use a development
build (`expo-dev-client`) compiled with `npx expo run:android` or
`npx expo run:ios`.

EAS is **not** required. Do not add an Expo account, EAS project, or `eas.json`
for this initial project.

## Prerequisites

Install the shared toolchain from
[`docs/mobile-development-environment.md`](../../docs/mobile-development-environment.md)
before the first native build.

On both platforms:

- Node.js 24 LTS
- Git
- JDK 17, with `JAVA_HOME` pointing at that JDK
- Android Studio with Android SDK Platform 36, Build-Tools 36.0.0, platform-tools, and an API 36 Google APIs emulator image

`ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) must point at the SDK:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk`
- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Android/sdk`

iOS additionally requires macOS, Xcode 26.4 or newer, the iOS Simulator runtime,
and CocoaPods. `npx expo run:ios` installs pods during prebuild.

## Clean checkout

From the repository root:

```powershell
cd src/QueenZone.Mobile
node --version   # v24.x
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Generate native projects from committed Expo config (Continuous Native
Generation). Do not commit the resulting `android/` or `ios/` directories.

### Android (Windows or macOS)

```powershell
npx expo run:android
```

This generates `android/`, compiles a development-client APK, installs it on a
running emulator or device, and starts the Metro bundler. Rebuild the native
app only after changing native dependencies, `app.json`, or the Expo SDK:

```powershell
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

JavaScript-only changes use:

```powershell
npx expo start --dev-client
```

### iOS (macOS only)

```bash
npx expo run:ios
```

This generates `ios/`, installs CocoaPods, compiles a Simulator development
client, and starts Metro. The same `--clean` prebuild rule as Android applies
when native configuration changes.

## Navigation shell

React Navigation provides the app shell ([ADR 0012](../../docs/decisions/0012-react-navigation-app-shell.md)).

Signed-out tabs: **Today · News · Photos · Forum · You**.

Signed-in tabs add **Messages** (member-only, matching the website header).

Placeholder screens exist for Epics 1–6. You → **Sign in (development)** toggles
the local session until the Epic 0 token client is wired. Member-only routes
also render a sign-in gate so they stay closed while signed out.

Rebuild the development client after this native dependency set changes
(`react-native-screens`, `react-native-safe-area-context`, `react-native-svg`):

```powershell
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:android
```

## What this scaffold does not include

- Design-token theme — #792
- Per-environment API base URL — #793
- GitHub Actions Android/iOS compile pipeline — #794
